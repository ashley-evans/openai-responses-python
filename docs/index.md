# Introduction

Pytest plugin for automatically mocking OpenAI requests. See the [user guide](user_guide/index.md) to get started.

!!! note

    This project does not try to generate fake responses from the models. Any part of a response that would be generated by a model will need to
    be defined by the user or will be left as the fallback value (i.e. empty string for `str` type fields).

## Installation

Available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/openai-responses/)

=== "pip"

    ```shell
    pip install openai-responses
    ```

=== "poetry"

    ```shell
    poetry add --group dev openai-responses
    ```

## Why use this?

For building production-ready AI features, you need to add tests to your code. A lot of work and attention is going into evals but the performance of the AI model is only part of the testing story.
Your AI features live with all of the other code in your app and you need to be able to test those interactions.

To avoid actually using the OpenAI endpoints in your tests - which cost money and are probabilistic - you can mock those calls so that everything works the way it will in production but with predetermined responses.
